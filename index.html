  <p> SENTIENT ELEMENT <a href="https://www.sentientlight.com/">PEMF Devices</a> :</p>
<p>PEMF (PULSED ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THERAPY), also known as low field magnetic stimulation, uses electromagnetic fields to heal fractures, depression, and many other diseases.
REASONS FOR USING SENTIENT:</p>
<p>Here are some reasons for using this pemf devices:</p>
<ul><li>
  1.	Some people are afraid of medicine, so this machine transfers your mixture into your body without using any physical component like pills and needles. Instead, it uses an electromagnetic field to move the drug directly into your body, and it has no side effects.</li>
<li>2.	Many diseases need good therapy to cure them. But this is the only machine that can treat almost every significant illness out there, like bone fractures, insomnia, chronic pain, and many other diseases. Still, the shocking news is that it can also cure cancer.</li>
<li>3.	The main factor of using this machine is saving your time and money because you don't need therapy sessions or appointments with your therapist. After all, once you learn how to use this machine, you can efficiently operate it on your own and set it up in your home. This machine is user-friendly.</li>
<li>4.	Sentient Element is used to cure diseases and is also used to remove toxins from old cells and make them like new; PEMF uses 70 to 120 millivolts of current to transfer oxygen and other nutrients and exchange them with toxic cells.</li>
<li>5.	The size of the conscious Element is not more than a small suitcase, so it is easy to transport. You can take it on your vacations, or somewhere you have to go, without missing your therapy, and it is lightweight so that you can carry it without any difficulties.</li>
<li>6.	The most crucial reason for having this machine is that it doesn't negatively impact your body or say it doesn't have any after-effects. We all have seen that medical science hasn't produced any medicine without side effects, even in this modern era. Even consuming drugs affect your health, So what difference does it make if you are curing one disease and creating a new one in your body. Then this cycle carries on, You fix one condition, and then another takes place, So what's the benefit of using the medicine. This is the most significant difference between sentient Element and physical Element.</li>
